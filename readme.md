An intelligent, on-device system designed to enforce helmet use and enhance road safety for two-wheeler riders. This project was developed as a final-year B.Tech project in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru.

## üìñ Introduction

[cite_start]Motorcycle fatalities are strongly correlated with the non-usage of helmets[cite: 649]. [cite_start]This project presents an embedded, on-device Machine Learning system that detects helmet usage and enforces a safety interlock on the motorcycle's ignition circuit[cite: 651].

[cite_start]The core of the system is an **STM32H7 microcontroller** running a custom TensorFlow Lite model trained on **Edge Impulse**[cite: 618, 692]. [cite_start]It uses an infrared (IR) camera to ensure reliable detection day or night[cite: 620, 621]. [cite_start]If a helmet is not detected, the system initiates a 3-minute warning before safely disabling the ignition via a relay[cite: 625, 626]. All processing is done locally, ensuring **low latency** and **100% privacy**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **On-Device ML Inference**: All helmet detection is performed directly on the microcontroller. [cite_start]No cloud connection is needed, ensuring privacy and real-time performance[cite: 627, 695].
-   [cite_start]**Infrared (IR) Imaging for Low-Light Robustness**: An array of IR LEDs is automatically activated in low-light conditions, guaranteeing reliable detection 24/7[cite: 621, 900].
-   [cite_start]**Fail-Safe Ignition Control**: A relay is connected to the motorcycle's kill-switch line, which defaults to an "off" state, preventing ignition if the system fails or loses power[cite: 705, 989].
-   [cite_start]**Humane Warning System**: If a rider is detected without a helmet, a 3-minute countdown is displayed on an LCD, giving the rider ample time to comply before ignition is disabled[cite: 625].
-   [cite_start]**Deterministic & Low-Power Operation**: The system performs a check every 15 minutes using the Real-Time Clock (RTC), balancing safety enforcement with minimal power consumption[cite: 625, 901].
-   [cite_start]**Retrofit-Friendly Design**: Designed as a generic module that can be fitted to any two-wheeler, whether it has an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) or is an Electric Vehicle (EV)[cite: 902].

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

The project followed a structured development methodology, from initial requirements to final validation.
